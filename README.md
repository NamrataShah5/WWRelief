# WWRelief
WWRelief is an interactive map to help users visualize where natural disasters and manmade destruction is most prevalent. 
This web app was built in hopes of educating young people (elementary-high school students) about what they can do to prevent 
environmental damage as well as donate to support those who have faced adversity from natural disasters.

WWRelief was built on Atom, using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
